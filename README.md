# Country_Search
The project connects to a database containing information about countries, such as capital, population, and official languages. A website was created to allow users to make SQL queries in a user-friendly interface, using various filter conditions. This project was undertaken to fulfill the requirements of our Web Development course, which is a part of our System Analysis and Development degree.

The database used can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jaconza/1309302/raw/66caa0146c22b0bca913738b8be8ef35aea83a39/word_country_data.sql).
